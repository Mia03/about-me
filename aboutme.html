<p><h3>It's me. I'm currently 5,303 days old, which is kind of a weird coincidence since my birthday has the same numbers. I've come to realize what theys say is true, that middle school and high school are FILLED with drama. But what can I say? Life is pretty great. I found out I was taking a college class today and I didn't even know it.</h3></p>

<p><h3>I love Christmas. Christmas is less a holiday and more just a state of mind for me. I love it because I get to listen to and sing Christmas music without being judged...most of the time. I also get to see my family members that I don't get to see as often. There's also the presents, but those aren't as prevelent for me. I love to decorate and wrap presents and hand out everyone's presents. I write my own music, but I'm usually to scared to show anyone. I'm so critical of myself! If I figure out how to, I might put one of my songs on here. I'll try. I feel like putting a poem on here so I'm gonna do that now.</h3></p>
